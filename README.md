# PHP Function Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: a function missing a return statement when a return value is implicitly or explicitly expected. This often leads to unexpected behavior or runtime errors, especially when the function is used as part of a larger application.

## Bug

The `bug.php` file contains a function (`myFunction()`) that is missing a return statement.  When called, this function will implicitly return `null`, which might not be the expected behavior if the function was intended to return something else.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.php` file provides the corrected version of the function, explicitly adding a return statement to return the expected value. This ensures that the function behaves as intended, preventing errors or unexpected results.
